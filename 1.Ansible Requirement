Ansible Requirements -- Python, PIP, and Virtual environments
=============================================================
1) Requirements for installing Ansible
2) Python 2 versus Python 3  for using Ansible
3) Options for installing Ansible on different operating systems
4) PIP, the python package management system and ansible
5) Python Virtual Environment with ansible.

Ansible is a automation framework written in python language. 
comparision of installation method

                      Install multiple      User has specific       OS vendor support       upgrade         windows         Mac             Linux
                      version of ansible    control over ansible    for ansible             path
                      on same system        version

1) Pip installed      yes, when using           yes                 Yes/No, PIP             Yes,user        yes, however    yes, this is      Yes
Ansible through       virtual env.                                  installed pkg would     can upgrade     windows is      preferred
existing python                                                     typically fall out      via PIP to      not supported   approach acc

                                                                    support contract &

2) OS specific          No                   No, Ansible version    yes/No, depend on       yes, limited        N/A              N/A              Yes

3) Activestate          No                  No, Ansible version     Yes through             yes, limited        No                yes            yes
python installed                            defined by pkg that     Activestate subject     to availability
through Activestate                         is avialable            to contract             of pkg
package manager

From all of the above options we will be focusing on option 1 that is installing the ansible using PIP
 PIP installation of ansible works well with Python virtual environment

In python there are installation area where package can be installed and those are called as virtual environment in
python
We could use either python 2 or 3 to install packages
Suppose we have 3 virtual environment and we have activitated Virtual environment 1 out of the available Virtual
environment then the package we will install using PIP will be installed inside that Virtual environment which will be 
active.

So for example if we issue a command "pip install ansible" then this is going to install current version of ansible 
available from pyPI(python package index) into the virtual environment.

Also if we want to install any specific version of ansible we can issue below command
pip install ansible==2.0.0.1

note that python environments separates your working environment from main python installation, providing a varity 
of advantages. Like
    a) it keeps working environment clean, as all the changes are applied to the virtual environment and not on the 
        system installed python
    b) There will be less dependencies as to create virtual environment we need to not be a root user as they can be 
        created using normal user as well
    c) Virtual environments provide convenience means for upgrading ansible
