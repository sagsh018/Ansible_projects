1) In this lecture we are going to do the ansible setup on our ubuntu-c host and it is this setup of ansible we are 
    going to use throughout this course.
2) We are going to be using python, Virtual environment and pip to install ansible
3) Lets bring up the ubuntu-c with same kind of netowrk configuration as mentioned in the previous lecture
4) We also need to make sure that our dnsmasq server is also up and running as we need it to be running in order to 
    DNS resolution. So lets bring it up as well
5) Then after bringing up dnsmasq we will do two ping tests:
    a) ping dnsmasq
    b) ping google.com
    Both of these test should pass
6) Next thing that we are going to do on ubuntu-c os update the apt in order to bring up the machine with latest 
    softwares and packages
    # sudo apt-get update
7) After updating we will install below packages
    # sudo apt-get install python-minimal virtualenv python-dev build-essential
8) Then lets create our first virtaul environment using python under /home/packt home directory
    # virtualenv venv27
9) Then lets activate the virtual environment with below command
    # source venv27/bin/activate
    and this will change the prompt and it will become like below
    packt@ubuntu-c:~$ source venv27/bin/activate
    (venv27) packt@ubuntu-c:~$
10 Check the python and pip, both should come from within the virtualenv
    which python
    which pip
    ========================================
    (venv27) packt@ubuntu-c:~$ which python
`   /home/packt/venv27/bin/python
    (venv27) packt@ubuntu-c:~$ which pip
    /home/packt/venv27/bin/pip
    ========================================
11) Now before installing ansible we are going to set our version of setup tools at version 45 for compatibility 
    # pip install --upgrade 'setuptools<45.0.0'
12) Then we will finally install ansible using pip
    # pip install ansible==2.5.0
13) Then we can check the ansible version 
    # ansible --version
