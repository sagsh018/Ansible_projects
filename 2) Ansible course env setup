1) So here we are going to setup out lab using below two things
    a) Oracle VM virtual box
    b) Avialbale Virtual machines which are already created and can be retrieved from below shared drive
        https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QBgNs6knbwpSPyUMexDXhKjv3TO_Ka55
2) Our environment will be made up of 8 hosts 
    a) Ubuntu-c ==> Ansible control hosts 
    b) centos1 to centos3 ==> 
    c) ubuntu1 to ubuntu3 ==> 
    d) dnsmasq ==> configured with DNS masq service. This act as a nameserver for the local nodes and as a forwarding 
        DNS server.
        Note that this server act as a DNS server for all the other above mentioned servers.
        You will have to have this DNS machine for other machines to work as expected.
3) So now lets download all the virtual machine archives from the below mentioned google drive link
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QBgNs6knbwpSPyUMexDXhKjv3TO_Ka55
    and save them under D:\software
4) Now note that all these 8 virtual machines are being configured in virtual box with two network adapters. both the 
    virtual machine adapters should be bridged to the same network adapter on the local system, and that adapter should 
    do IP assignment and internet connectivity through DHCP. 
    DHCP is typically used on home internet to do the following tasks
        a) Dynamic assignment of IP addresses
        b) support temperarory leases of IP addresses
        c) provide all necessary IP configuration parameters
        d) Typically used on consumer internet routers and wifi access points.
5) Suppose if you access the internet on your computer through the wifi router then the adapter will be bridged in the
    two adaptors too in your VM, will be this wifi adapter 
    Adaptor 1 ==> is configured in the system in order to use DHCP to get an IP address. So when this adaptor on VM is
    bridged with DHCP enabled adaptor, the it automatically assign the IP to adaptor 1 for each of the 8 VM'same
    Adaptor 2 ==> is configured with static IP address. each of these VM's will have static IP of 192.168.0.4x IP as 
    below
    dnsmasq == 192.168.0.40
    ubuntu-c == 192.168.0.41
    ubuntu-1 == 192.168.0.42
    ubuntu-2 == 192.168.0.43
    ubuntu-3 == 192.168.0.44
    centos-1 == 192.168.0.45
    centos-2 == 192.168.0.46
    centos-3 == 192.168.0.47
    Now as this adaptor is also bridged to our main network, if we are set a IP address on our system in the same range as
    192.168.0.4x. Then we would be able to access all these VM by the static IP address as well.
6) Account information for all the VM'same      
    a) packt user, password == password
    b) root user, password == password
    c) Centos VM's == root access permitted
    d) ubuntu VM's == root access by means of sudo from packt user 
7) Now after we have downloaded all the VM's from the google drive mentioned above, we have store all the ZIP file for VM's
    under D drive as mentioned previously.
8) Then lets open our command prompt on local windows machine and check the current IP details
    Wireless LAN adapter Wireless Network Connection:

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::114b:
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.6
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : fe80::1%13
                                       192.168.1.1
    So we have noted down here the information about our current IPv4 address which is provided using DHCP, and Subnet
    mask, and also the default gateway
9) Now, once we have checked that we have virtual Box installed, we can directly go into the location where we 
    have kept all our VM's and start extracting them all, and once they are extracted then go inside that folder and 
    double click the Blue icon file(Virtualbox Machine Definition) and that will open the file inside Virtual box.
    repeat the same for all the VM'same
10) So once we have all our virtual machines in Virtual Box manager, we will go into the settings and go the network tab 
    there we will find the adapter options. Lets ope the Adapter 1 and adapter 2 and set up the settings for those two.
    By default Adapter 1 will be attached to bridged adapter and the name of that wireless WIFI adatper is :
        Wireless-N 2230
    and Adapter is also connected to the same : Wireless-N 2230
    Also note that we are going to keep adapter 3 and 4 as empty.
    We will keep the same settings of network for all the 8 virtual machines
11) Firstly we are going to bring up the "dnsmasq" VM .
    Now we can login to this machine using id : packt and password : password and switch to root from there with 
    same password
    now once we logged in we can see the network adapter configuration by : ifconfig -a
    Adapter 1 : enp0s3 ==> This is a DHCP adepter getting the IP dynamically
    Adepter 2 : enp0s8 ==> This is static adepter with IP : 192.168.0.40
12) Now we will bring up centos1, with same kind of network configuration
13) Similarly we will also bring up ubuntu1 VM as well and with same kind of Network configuration
14) once thats done we can check the connectivity of internet from all three servers. and then we can also check the 
    connectivity to the DNS server dnsmasq from other two centos and ununtu servers.
